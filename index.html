    <h4>Summer 2023 2D Video Games Brief Overview</h4>
    <p>&emsp;During the summer of 2023, prior to beginning the Master of Entertainment Arts, Engineering Track, at the University of Utah, I developed two 2D games in order to gain some experience in the field of video game development.</p>

    <h4>Graphics Town Auto</h4>
    <img src="gta.png" width="400"></img>
    <p>&emsp;This is a project that I did for the Graphics course offered at my school. This project's theme is Grand Theft Auto, my favorite video game. The game revolves around planning and engaging in heists and one of my favorite aspects of this game is the cars that you can buy and customize with money obtained from heists. Thus, I decided to add in a loop in which a car escapes after a bank heist and is chased by two police cars. This project includes various techniques that I learned throughout the semester, such as the dynamic environment map used for the reflection of the sculpture in the middle of the town or the various types of movements included in the town. I also included techniques that I discovered on my own, such as the drift smoke from the car which is in fact randomly placed spheres with varying color and opacity.

    <h4>Game AI</h4>
    <img src="teeko.png" width="200"></img>
    <p>&emsp;This is a project that I did for the Artificial Intelligence course offered at my school. The goal of the project was to develop an AI game player for a modified version of the game called Teeko using the Minimax algorithm. My AI player is able to follow the rules of this modified Teeko game, select a move in less than 5 seconds, and is capable of beating a random player in at least 2 out of 3 matches. Additionally, this AI player can play against a real player as can be seen above.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Collaborative Work</h2>
    <h4>Stock Portfolio</h4>
    <img src="stock.png" width="300"></img>
    <p>&emsp;For this project, I collaborated with team members to develop a website that logs and displays stock trades. My role for the project was being the test engineer, so I was in charge of testing the various code used for this project as well as presenting our work. This was an especially interesting project as we each had a distinct role and worked with one another to ensure that all of programs worked well together.</p>
